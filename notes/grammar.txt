Intransitive commands:
- This covers a lot of the more fundamental game commands
- Includes a lot of the non-diegetic inputs: 'save', 'load', 'quit'
- Any single-token input should be treated as an intransitive verb.
- If a single token input isn't in the list of intransitive commands, then check the list of transitive ones and tell the user they're missing a target/object
